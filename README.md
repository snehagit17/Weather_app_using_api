# Weather_app_using_api

Hello folks, 
I have made a Weather app using HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT and an api known as openweather api. This project taught me more about the uses of API and javascript. Here we can see everydays humidity, air pressure, day and night temperature and also the timing of the sunrise and sunset. 
I have used one api that also allows me to set the latitude and longigude.
